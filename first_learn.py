# Mutability vs Immutability

# Immutable objects are common in functional programming, while mutable objects are widely used in object-oriented programming. Because Python is a multiparadigm programming language, it provides mutable and immutable objects for you to choose from when solving a problem.

# To understand how mutable and immutable objects work in Python, you first need to understand a few related concepts. To kick things off, youâ€™ll take a look at variables and objects.



# Naming Convention 

# x = "JohnhnSmith"
# # x,z, y = x.split('n')
# lst = x.split()

# # print(f"{x} zzzz {z}, yyyyy {y}")
# print(lst)




# Change this as per structure way of nameing

# name= 'vishal singh'
# first_name,Last_name=name.split()
# print(f"{first_name}, {Last_name}")



# class classWith_method:
#    def first_method(self, height, weight):
#       return f"hello my name vishal and height {height}  and weight{weight}"
  
# person=classWith_method()

# result=person.first_method(178,78)
# print(result)
